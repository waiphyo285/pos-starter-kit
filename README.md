## Getting Started

This project is an **open-source web-based Point of Sale (POS) system** built with Node.js and structured using the **Clean Architecture** pattern. It helps developers and businesses launch scalable, modular backends quickly. The architecture promotes maintainability, separation of concerns, and flexibility for long-term development and commercial or personal POS system deployments.

Whether you prefer SQL databases like MySQL or NoSQL databases like MongoDB, this template serves as a powerful and flexible starting point. It provides essential features such as authentication, file upload handling, and built-in testing. Developers can immediately begin building robust applications on top of this production-ready backend framework.

You can **extend or enhance** this system to match your unique business needs, including inventory tracking, multi-store management, and customer loyalty programs. The design encourages customization with clean, reusable code, and modular services. This makes the system suitable for various industries including retail, restaurants, and service-based businesses with different operational flows.

This project is built with widely supported libraries and tools that are well-tested and community-backed. It ensures you have the flexibility to evolve the system as your needs grow. Whether for learning, freelancing, or enterprise-level deployments, this template gives you a dependable base to develop modern, feature-rich POS applications efficiently.

### üß∞ Prerequisites

-   Node.js,
-   MongoDB,
-   MySQL (optional)
-   Redis (optional)

### üöÄ Setup Instructions

**Clone repository**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/waiphyo285/pos-stater-kit.git
```

**Navigate root directory and install dependencies**

```bash
npm install
```

**Copy `.env.example` to `.env` then update it with your values (e.g., database settings, credentials)**

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

‚ö†Ô∏è If your database requires authentication (username/password), make sure to update the .env file accordingly. You may also need to adjust the connection logic in `models/mongodb/connection.js` to match your credentials and connection format.

**Run the application**

```bash
npm run dev
npm start
```

‚ö†Ô∏è Use npm run dev if you have nodemon installed globally. Otherwise npm start.

**TDD `./../.spec.js` in controllers**

```
npm run test
```

### üõ† CLI Commands (from src/cli)

```bash
node index
node index --index
node index --show=************************
```
